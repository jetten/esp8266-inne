Code for the NodeMCU ESP8266 developement board to serve the current temperature and humidity from a DHT22 sensor.

## Setup
Follow the instructions on Adafruit to install the ESP8266 library to your Arduino IDE:
http://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-huzzah-esp8266-breakout/using-arduino-ide
Then upload the Arduino sketch to the board.

The DHT22 sensor is connected to pin 5 in the Arduino code. This pin corresponds to D1 on the NodeMCU. See https://github.com/nodemcu/nodemcu-devkit for pin mappings.
